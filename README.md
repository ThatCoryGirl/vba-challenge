# vba-challenge
VBA coding project

In this challenge our bootcamp created a script that looped through stocks for each year giving year's changes from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the close price at the end of the year. We also included the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning and the closing price at the end. Each stock returned the greatest percentage increase, decrease and total volume. We made sure taht the script ran once per year, on every worksheet. Negative yearly changes were highlighted in red while positive changes were highlighted in green. This code was tested on a much smaller data set to make sure that it worked.

I first declared my variables or buckets. I wrote it so that the code at the top would happen to every worksheet before the nested loop. I filled the buckets or variables. I used if then statements and functions. I made sure percentages and other values were formatted correctly. And finally I made sure that the text fit in each cell. In my code, you can see where I tried message boxes to make sure things worked. You can also see the evolution of my code in my commentary where I started small and got bigger via scale.
